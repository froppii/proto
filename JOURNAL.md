# Froppii's Protogen Head
**26 May - Researched a bit on what things I needed**

I looked at some videos and asked a bunch of people in some discord servers for their experiences building their suits and some estimation of the cost! I also pieced together a simple bom (although it was a bit too pricy)

**27 May - Added some changes to the bom and started designing/cadding** 
Today I made a BOM that I think is pretty much complete, the essential things I needed are included including some extras. I also found out that borrowing a vacuum former/vacuum forming services turned out to be much much cheaper than pre made visors, although undyed so I need to find a way to do that.

I also started doing the cadding and designing! Made a simple drawing for the shape of the back part of the head
